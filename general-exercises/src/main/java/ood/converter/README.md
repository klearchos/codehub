# Problem Description

Design an application that will receive an object and if it is a number it will convert it to 
Octal, Binary and Hexadecimal.
If it is a string then it will print the message in uppercase. 
Use the chain of command pattern.

Variation: Use the solution from the initial description in order to increase the number by 1
for every class that makes a conversion. If it is a string do not do anything special.
