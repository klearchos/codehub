# Problem Description

We need to have build a shopping cart application that will sell apples and oranges.
The apples cost 0.5 and the oranges 0.3.
Build a simple application that will calculate the total sum of all the products
that the shopping cart contains.

Step 1:
For example [Apple, Apple, Orange] -> 1.3 

Step 2:
The owner of the shop decides to introduce some new offers:
- Buy one apple get one free.
- Three for the price of two for the oranges.

Think all the different design patterns that could be applied.
