# Problem Description

Design an application that will encrypt and decrypt some text.

Operations required:
1. Encrypt text with algorithm "A"
2. Encrypt text with algorithm "B"
3. Encrypt text with algorithm "C"
4. Decrypt text with algorithm "A"
5. Decrypt text with algorithm "B"
6. Decrypt text with algorithm "C"
 
Note: We do not care about the actual algorithms here. 
For the classes that implement the algorithms a simple System.out.println("Text encrypted with algorithm A");
is enough.  

The important part is how you will design your solution for this problem in order to be 
easily maintainable and extensible in the future.
